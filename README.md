My thought on GitHub is that it is similar to face book for programmers. You can follow a friend or company. You can put code out on the site. This will get you exposure so people will know that you know what you are doing.  Also allow you to share you code with other programmers. Also allows the programmer to share in different project s they are in. 

It allows you to follow people or companies so you have an idea what they or that company is about. Also you maybe able to get some names or hints on how to get a job with that company. Because you know what they are looking for in a candidate for a job with them. You may be able to find out what languages they need help in. 

In other words this is use for a social networking like in facebook or linkedin. This is very helpful to get jobs or get use in other areas or project by other people.
